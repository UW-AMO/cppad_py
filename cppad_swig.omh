$section cppad_swig: A C++ Object Library and SWIG Interface to CppAD$$

$head Goal$$
Provide a link from any scripting language supported by
$href%http://www.swig.org%swig%$$
to the
$href%https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD%cppad%$$
algorithmic differentiation package.
In addition, the C++ library that does the computations is specified
and can be linked directly by other programs (besides swig wrappers).

$head Under Construction$$
This is a preliminary version of $code cppad_swig$$.
Only a few AD functions have been implemented and are being used
for initial testing.
The currently working scripting languages, operating systems are:
$table
python $cnext Linux, msys $rnext
octave $cnext Linux $rnext
perl   $cnext Linux
$tend
Only testing, and no installation, is currently implemented.

$head Testing$$
You must first configure cppad_swig for your system using
$cref run_cmake.sh$$.
When you do so, the set of available tests would be output
as messages of the form
$codei%
	make check_%test_name%: available
%$$
You can change into the $code build$$ subdirectory and enter the command
$codei%
	make check_%test_name%
%$$
for each such test.

	example/example_lib.omh
