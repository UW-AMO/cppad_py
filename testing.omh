$section Running the Cppad Swig Tests$$

$children%
	bin/run_cmake.sh
%$$
$head Configuration$$
You must first configure Cppad Swig for your system using
$cref run_cmake.sh$$.

$head Available Tests$$
After $code bin/run_cmake.sh$$, the following command will list
the available tests:
$codei%
	grep 'make check' cmake_cppad_swig.log
%$$
Note that this command must be executed in the
$cref/source directory/cppad_swig/Source Directory/$$.

$head Binary Directory$$
You can determine the $icode binary_directory$$ with the command
$codei%
	grep CMAKE_BINARY_DIR cmake_cppad_swig.log
%$$
This, and the previous command, assume your are in the source directory.
The rest of the commands below assume you are in the
Cmake binary directory.

$head check$$
The command
$codei%
	make check
%$$
will run all of the available tests.

$head Octave$$
Swig versions before 3.0.12 do not support Octave-4.2; see
$href%https://github.com/swig/swig/pull/875%issue 875%$$.
For this reason, you should use an older version of Octave
(until Swig-3.0.12 or greater is available).
On Cygwin $code Octave-4.0.1-2$$ has problems in its
include files that require one to add the flag
$codei%
	-I/usr/include/octave-4.0.1/octave
%$$
to the value of
$cref/swig_cxx_flags/run_cmake.sh/swig_cxx_flags/$$ in $code run_cmake.sh$$.

$head cppad_swig_lib$$
On some systems, the following dynamically linked library may not be found:
$codei%
	%binary_directory%/lib/libcppad_swig_lib.%*%
%$$
Depending on your system,
you may be able to use one of the following commands to fix this:
$codei%
	PATH="%binary_directory%/lib:@PATH"
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH="%binary_directory%/lib:@LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
%$$

$head check_swig_xam$$
For $icode lang$$ equal
$code cplusplus$$, $code octave$$, $code perl$$, $code python$$,
$codei%
	make check_swig_xam_%lang%
%$$
runs a simple test of Swig, for the particular language, on your system.

$subhead check_lib$$
For $icode lang$$ equal
$code cplusplus$$, $code octave$$, $code perl$$, $code python$$,
$codei%
	make check_lib_%lang%
%$$
runs a test of Cppad Swig, for the particular language, on your system.
