$head af$$
This object must have been returned by a previous call to the python
$cref/a_fun/py_a_fun_ctor/$$ constructor.

$head size_domain$$
The return value $icode n$$ is an $code int$$
and is the size of the vector
$cref/ax/py_a_fun_ctor/ax/$$ in the function constructor; i.e.,
the number of independent variables.

$head size_range$$
The return value $icode m$$ is an $code int$$
and is the size of the vector
$cref/ay/py_a_fun_ctor/ay/$$ in the function constructor; i.e.,
the number of dependent variables.

$head size_var$$
The return value $icode v$$ is an $code int$$
and is the number of variables in the function.
This includes the independent variables, dependent variables,
and any variables that are used to compute the dependent variables
from the independent variables.

$head size_op$$
The return value $icode p$$ is an $code int$$
and is the number of atomic operations that are used to express
the dependent variables as a function of the independent variables.

$head size_order$$
The return value $icode q$$ is an $code int$$
and is the number of Taylor coefficients currently stored in $icode af$$,
for every variable in the operation sequence corresponding to $icode af$$.
These coefficients are computed by $cref py_a_fun_forward$$.
This is different from the other function properties in that it can change
after each call to $icode%af%.forward%$$; see
$cref/size_order/py_a_fun_forward/p/size_order/$$ in the forward mode section.
